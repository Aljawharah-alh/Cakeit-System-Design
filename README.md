# 🍰 Cakelt - Custom Cake Ordering App
**Software Engineering Project | Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University**

## 📌 Project Overview
[cite_start]**Cakelt** is a specialized mobile application for a cake shop that bridges the gap between traditional bakeries and digital customization[cite: 2, 6]. [cite_start]It allows users to design their own cakes (flavors, fillings, decorations) and see a visual preview before ordering[cite: 7, 8].

### 🛠 The Problem We Solve
* [cite_start]**Limited Customization:** Traditional stores have fixed designs[cite: 10].
* [cite_start]**Communication Gap:** Ordering custom cakes via calls often leads to errors[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**No Preview:** Customers cannot visualize their design before it's made[cite: 12].
